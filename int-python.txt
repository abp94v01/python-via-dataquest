A module is a collection of functions and variables that have been bundled together in a single file. We can import the module using the import statement e.g 
	import my_module # imports the my_module.py file

Access module functions using dot notation:
	my_module.some_function()

for example:
import math as m # alias for imported module
root = m.sqrt(99)

A namespace is a dictionary that contains all of the names we can refer to in our code. 

csv module opens csv files to make them ready them to use within the python environment using the reader() function e.g.
import csv
f= open("nfl.csv")
csvreader = csv.reader(f) # reader function returns object as data
nfl = list(csvreader) # convert result to list 

 # Define a function which counts the number of team wins
def nfl_wins(team, data = nfl):
    team_wins = 0
    for row in data:
        if row[2] == team:
            team_wins = team_wins + 1
    return(team_wins)

cowboys_wins = nfl_wins("Dallas Cowboys")
falcons_wins = nfl_wins("Atlanta Falcons")
