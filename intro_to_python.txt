object oriented programming - object is a value or variable belonging to a specific class.
variable (var) = word
integer (int) = whole number
float (flt) = decimal number
string (str) = sentence using quotation marks

e.g. hello_world = "Hello World!" - no need to define that this is string, python handles that. no spaces, always use underscore.

print using print(hello_world) to get 
	Hello World!
print multiple variables, in the same line, by seperating with a comma in the arguement e.g.
print("name of", var_a)

type() function looks up the data type e.g. var, int, str etc e.g. 
	china_exact = 122.5
	print(type(china_exact))
This outputs the class as a float.

str() function converts to strings
int() function converts to integers e.g.
	china_rounded = 123
	int_to_str = str(china_rounded) # gives "123"
	str_to_int = int(int_to_str) # gives 123

use # instead of // to make comments in python

operators +,-,/,* and ** is used as power to e.g. p ** 2 is p squared.

assign [] to make an empty list e.g. months = []
list.append() is a METHOD which accepts a value and adds it to a list e.g.
	countries = []
	countries.append("China")
	countries.append("India")
	countries.append("United States")
	temperatures = []
	temperatures.append(122.5)
	temperatures.append(124.0)
	temperatures.append(134.1)
OR 
	temps = ["China", 122.5, "India", 124.0, "United States", 134.1]
which is much easier.

zero indexing is used in python which means the first variable is index value 0, then the second being index value 1 and so forth e.g.
	china = countries[0]
	china_temperature = temperatures[0]

len() function shows how many elements there are in a list e.g. len(countries) would be 3. The max index value would be len(countries) - 1 so  3 - 1 = 2

To only show some elements of a list you slice e.g.
	countries_slice = countries[1:4] # shows 2nd 3rd and 4th elements
	temperatures_slice = temperatures[3:len(temperatures)] # shows last three elements
